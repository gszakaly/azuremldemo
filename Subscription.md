## Create Azure free trial account

Navigate to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/.

Click *Start free*.

Log in with your IBM account. If you have multiple accounts with the IBM e-mail, choose *Work or school account*.

The free trial subscription includes a $200 credit, that can be used within 30 days. The subscription has some limitations, but generally allows to explore Azure extensively.

The most notable limitation regarding machine learning is that it does not allow to create VMs with GPU. In order to use GPU, you must convert your free trial subscription to pay-as-you-go and enter a credit card. The $200 credit can still be used within the 30 days period, but any usage above that or outside the 30 days will be charged.
